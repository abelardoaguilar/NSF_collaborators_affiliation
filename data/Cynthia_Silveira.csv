They store their genome at quasi-crystalline densities in capsids built from multiple copies of proteins adopting the HK97-fold. The high density of the genome exerts an internal pressure, requiring a maturation process that reinforces their capsids. However, it is unclear how capsid stabilization strategies have adapted to accommodate the evolution of larger genomes in this virus group. Here we characterized a novel capsid reinforcement mechanism in two evolutionary-related actinobacteriophages that modifies the length of a stabilization protein to accommodate a larger genome while maintaining the same capsid size. We used cryo-EM to reveal that capsids contained split hexamers of HK97-fold proteins with a stabilization protein in the chasm. The observation of split hexamers in mature capsids was unprecedented, so we rationalized this result mathematically, discovering that icosahedral capsids can be formed by all split or skewed hexamers as long as their T-number is not a multiple of three. Our results suggest that analogous stabilization mechanisms can be present in other icosahedral capsids, and they provide a strategy for engineering capsids accommodating larger DNA cargoes as gene delivery systems.","2023-11-03","2024-02-26 03:01:56","2024-02-26 03:01:56","2024-02-26 03:01:56","2023.11.03.565530","","","","","bioRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 37961133 PMCID: PMC10635136","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/46IPY82I/Podgorski et al. - 2023 - A novel stabilization mechanism accommodating geno.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10635136/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many prophages benefit their host, and prophages are responsible for genotypic and phenotypic differences that separate individual microbial strains. However, the microbes also endure a cost to maintain those phages: additional DNA to replicate and proteins to transcribe and translate. We have never quantified those benefits and costs. Here, we analysed over two and a half million prophages from over half a million bacterial genome assemblies. Analysis of the whole dataset and a representative subset of taxonomically diverse bacterial genomes demonstrated that the normalised prophage density was uniform across all bacterial genomes above 2 Mbp. We identified a constant carrying capacity of phage DNA per bacterial DNA. We estimated that each prophage provides cellular services equivalent to approximately 2.4 % of the cell’s energy or 0.9 ATP per bp per hour. We demonstrate analytical, taxonomic, geographic, and temporal disparities in identifying prophages in bacterial genomes that provide novel targets for identifying new phages. We anticipate that the benefits bacteria accrue from the presence of prophages balance the energetics involved in supporting prophages.

The dynamics of our world at biogeochemical, ecological, and astronomical scales exist in a transient state because our planet, Sun, and universe are evolving toward thermodynamic equilibrium. However, predicting the tipping points associated with major dynamical shifts in these systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a new theoretical framework to predict tipping points. Our approach builds on two empirical principles: Observations occur over a finite time, and changes are perceptible when system variations are substantial relative to reference values. As a consequence, processes governing the dynamics of a system can become inactive over an observation time, and tipping points are reached when the processes switch off or on. The two principles were encoded mathematically, defining dynamic weights: contributions relative to reference values of the dynamic processes to the rate-of-change of agents in the system for a finite observational time. Operationally, processes were considered active if their weights were above a critical threshold. Tipping points were defined as reaching critical thresholds that activated or inactivated processes. This Finite Observational Dynamics Analysis Method (FODAM) method predicted that a system with n underlying dynamic processes could display 2n different dynamic regimes. However, the regimes depend on the observational time. The tipping points predicted the conditions for regime shifts and also the resilience of quasi-stable systems to perturbations. The application of FODAM was illustrated with a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model featuring the interaction of bacteria and bacteriophage. A Colab notebook was also developed and deployed online to facilitate the application of the method to other systems. We conclude the article by discussing how our new approach bridges prior frameworks describing tipping point dynamics and critical transitions. We also outline the application of the method to empirical data to predict tipping points in complex systems.","2023-12-27","2024-02-26 03:10:52","2024-02-26 03:10:52","2024-02-26 03:10:52","","","","","","","","","","","","bioRxiv","","en","© 2023, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Their ecological, evolutionary, and biogeochemical roles in the planet stem from their genomic diversity. Known tailed phage genomes range from 10 to 735 kilobase pairs thanks to the size variability of the protective protein capsids that store them. However, the role of tailed phage capsids’ diversity in ecosystems is unclear. A fundamental gap is the difficulty of associating genomic information with viral capsids in the environment. To address this problem, here, we introduce a computational approach to predict the capsid architecture (T-number) of tailed phages using the sequence of a single gene—the major capsid protein. This approach relies on an allometric model that relates the genome length and capsid architecture of tailed phages. This allometric model was applied to isolated phage genomes to generate a library that associated major capsid proteins and putative capsid architectures. This library was used to train machine learning methods, and the most computationally scalable model investigated (random forest) was applied to human gut metagenomes. Compared to isolated phages, the analysis of gut data reveals a large abundance of mid-sized (T = 7) capsids, as expected, followed by a relatively large frequency of jumbo-like tailed phage capsids (T ≥ 25) and small capsids (T = 4) that have been under-sampled. We discussed how to increase the method’s accuracy and how to extend the approach to other viruses. The computational pipeline introduced here opens the doors to monitor the ongoing evolution and selection of viral capsids across ecosystems.","2022-01-01","2024-02-26 03:11:21","2024-02-26 03:11:21","2024-02-26 03:11:21","721-732","","","20","","Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/22NUBN2T/Lee et al. - 2022 - Predicting the capsid architecture of phages from .pdf; /home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/JQZLVF9H/S2001037021005419.html","","","Gut microbiome; Icosahedral capsids; Machine learning; Metagenomes; Physical modeling; Physical virology; Tailed bacteriophages; Viral ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we review the mechanisms regulating lysogeny in complex communities and show that the additive effects of coinfections, diversity and host energic status yield a bimodal distribution of lysogeny as a function of microbial densities. At high cell densities (above 106 cells ml−1 or g−1) and low diversity, coinfections by two or more phages are frequent and excess energy availability stimulates inefficient metabolism. Both mechanisms favour phage integration and characterize the Piggyback-the-Winner dynamic. At low densities (below 105 cells ml−1 or g−1), starvation represses lytic genes and extends the time window for lysogenic commitment, resulting in a higher frequency of coinfections that cause integration. This pattern follows the predictions of the refugium hypothesis. At intermediary densities (between 105 and 106 cells ml−1 or g−1), encounter rates and efficient energy metabolism favour lysis. This may involve Kill-the-Winner lytic dynamics and induction. Based on these three regimes, we propose a framework wherein phage integration occurs more frequently at both ends of the host density gradient, with distinct underlying molecular mechanisms (coinfections and host metabolism) dominating at each extreme.","2021","2024-02-26 03:11:58","2024-02-26 03:11:58","2024-02-26 03:11:58","4098-4111","","8","23","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1462-2920.15640","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/DMCJEMEQ/Silveira et al. - 2021 - The landscape of lysogeny across microbial communi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Corals harvest energy through their surface by photosynthesis and heterotrophic feeding, and they divert part of this energy to defend their outer colony perimeter against competitors. Here, we hypothesized that corals with a larger space-filling surface and smaller perimeters increase energy gain while reducing the exposure to competitors. This predicted an association between these two geometric properties of corals and the competitive outcome against other benthic organisms. To test the prediction, fifty coral colonies from the Caribbean island of Curaçao were rendered using digital 3D and 2D reconstructions. The surface areas, perimeters, box-counting dimensions (as a proxy of surface and perimeter space-filling), and other geometric properties were extracted and analyzed with respect to the percentage of the perimeter losing or winning against competitors based on the coral tissue apparent growth or damage. The increase in surface space-filling dimension was the only significant single indicator of coral winning outcomes, but the combination of surface space-filling dimension with perimeter length increased the statistical prediction of coral competition outcomes. Corals with larger surface space-filling dimensions (Ds > 2) and smaller perimeters displayed more winning outcomes, confirming the initial hypothesis. We propose that the space-filling property of coral surfaces complemented with other proxies of coral competitiveness, such as life history traits, will provide a more accurate quantitative characterization of coral competition outcomes on coral reefs. This framework also applies to other organisms or ecological systems that rely on complex surfaces to obtain energy for competition.","2021-06-29","2024-02-26 03:12:24","2024-02-26 03:12:24","2024-02-26 03:12:24","e11213","","","9","","PeerJ","","","","","","","","en","","","","","peerj.com","","Publisher: PeerJ Inc.","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/K28SMTBM/George et al. - 2021 - Space-filling and benthic competition on coral ree.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various physicochemical properties can alter the diffusion of microscopic particles in mucus, impacting drug delivery, virus infection, and disease development. The simultaneous effect of these physicochemical properties in particle diffusion, however, remains elusive. Here, we analyzed 106 published experiments to identify the most dominant factors controlling particle diffusion in mucus. The effective diffusion—defined using a one-second sampling time window across experiments—spanned seven orders of magnitude, from 10–5 to 102 μm2/s. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses identified the anomalous exponent (the logarithmic slope of the mean-squared displacement) as the strongest predictor of effective diffusion, revealing an exponential relationship that explained 89% of the variance. A theoretical scaling analysis revealed that a stronger correlation of the anomalous exponent over the generalized diffusion constant occurs for sampling times two orders of magnitude larger than the characteristic molecular (or local) displacement time. This result predicts that at these timescales, the molecular properties controlling the anomalous exponent, like particle–mucus unbinding times or the particle to mesh size ratio, would be the most relevant physicochemical factors involved in passive microrheology of particles in mucus. Our findings contrast with the fact that only one-third of the studies measured the anomalous exponent, and most experiments did not report the associated molecular properties predicted to dominate the motion of particles in mucus. The theoretical foundation of our work can be extrapolated to other systems, providing a guide to identify dominant molecular mechanisms regulating the mobility of particles in mucus and other polymeric fluids.","2021","2024-02-26 03:13:54","2024-02-26 03:14:55","2024-02-26 03:13:54","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/WRS75VMR/Cobarrubia et al. - 2021 - Empirical and Theoretical Analysis of Particle Dif.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lysogens are dominant in the microbially dense environment of the mammalian gut. This observation contrasts with the long-standing hypothesis of lysogeny being favored at low microbial densities, such as in oligotrophic marine environments. Here, we hypothesized that phage coinfections—a well-understood molecular mechanism of lysogenization—increase at high microbial abundances. To test this hypothesis, we developed a biophysical model of coinfection for marine and gut microbiomes. The model stochastically sampled ranges of phage and bacterial concentrations, adsorption rates, lysogenic commitment times, and community diversity from each environment. In 90% of the sampled marine communities, less than 10% of the bacteria were predicted to be lysogenized via coinfection. In contrast, 25% of the sampled gut communities displayed more than 25% of lysogenization. The probability of lysogenization in the gut was a consequence of the higher densities and higher adsorption rates. These results suggest that, on average, coinfections can form two trillion lysogens in the human gut every day. In marine microbiomes, which were characterized by lower densities and phage adsorption rates, lysogeny via coinfection was still possible for communities with long lysogenic commitment times. Our study indicates that different physical factors causing coinfections can reconcile the traditional view of lysogeny at poor host growth (long commitment times) and the recent Piggyback-the-Winner framework proposing that lysogeny is favored in rich environments (high densities and adsorption rates). IMPORTANCE The association of temperate phages and bacterial hosts during lysogeny manipulates microbial dynamics from the oceans to the human gut. Lysogeny is well studied in laboratory models, but its environmental drivers remain unclear. Here, we quantified the probability of lysogenization caused by phage coinfections, a well-known trigger of lysogeny, in marine and gut microbial environments. Coinfections were quantified by developing a biophysical model that incorporated the traits of viral and bacterial communities. Lysogenization via coinfection was more frequent in highly productive environments like the gut, due to higher microbial densities and higher phage adsorption rates. At low cell densities, lysogenization occurred in bacteria with long duplication times. These results bridge the molecular understanding of lysogeny with the ecology of complex microbial communities.","2020-09-15","2024-02-26 03:16:03","2024-02-26 03:16:03","2024-02-26 03:16:03","10.1128/msystems.00353-20","","5","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.asm.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Society for Microbiology","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/U3UB6LAL/Luque and Silveira - 2020 - Quantification of Lysogeny Caused by Phage Coinfec.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This contrasts the classical view of lysogeny as a refuge used by phages under poor host growth conditions. Here we hypothesize that as carrying capacity increases, lysogens escape phage top-down control through superinfection exclusion, overcoming the canonical trade-off between competition and resistance. This hypothesis was tested by developing an ecological model that combined lytic and lysogenic communities and a diversification model that estimated the accumulation of prophages in bacterial genomes. The ecological model sampled phage-bacteria traits stochastically for communities ranging from 1 to 1000 phage-bacteria pairs, and it included a fraction of escaping lysogens proportional to the increase in carrying capacity. The diversification model introduced new prophages at each diversification step and estimated the distribution of prophages per bacteria using combinatorics. The ecological model recovered the range of abundances and sublinear relationship between phage and bacteria observed across eleven ecosystems. The diversification model predicted an increase in the number of prophages per genome as bacterial abundances increased, in agreement with the distribution of prophages on 833 genomes from marine and human-associated bacteria. The study of lysogeny presented here offers a framework to interpret viral and microbial abundances and reconciles the Kill-the-Winner and Piggyback-the-Winner paradigms in viral ecology.","2020-04-09","2024-02-26 03:16:33","2024-02-26 03:16:33","2024-02-26 03:16:33","","","","","","","","","","","","bioRxiv","","en","© 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Here, we surveyed spatial variability in the densities of major coral reef functional groups at 122 sites along a 70 km expanse of the leeward, forereef habitat of Curaçao in the southern Caribbean. These data were used to test the degree to which spatial variability in community composition could be predicted based on assumed functional relationships and site-specific anthropogenic, physical, and ecological conditions. In general, models revealed less power to describe the spatial variability of fish biomass than cover of reef builders (R2 of best-fit models: 0.25 [fish] and 0.64 [reef builders]). The variability in total benthic cover of reef builders was best described by physical (wave exposure and reef relief) and ecological (turf algal height and coral recruit density) predictors. No metric of anthropogenic pressure was related to spatial variation in reef builder cover. In contrast, total fish biomass showed a consistent (albeit weak) association with anthropogenic predictors (fishing and diving pressure). As is typical of most environmental gradients, the spatial patterns of both fish biomass density and reef builder cover were spatially autocorrelated. Residuals from the best-fit model for fish biomass retained a signature of spatial autocorrelation while the best-fit model for reef builder cover removed spatial autocorrelation, thus reinforcing our finding that environmental predictors were better able to describe the spatial variability of reef builders than that of fish biomass. As we seek to understand spatial variability of coral reef communities at the scale of most management units (i.e., at kilometer- to island-scales), distinct and scale-dependent perspectives will be needed when considering different functional groups.","2022-08-01","2024-02-26 08:46:06","2024-02-26 08:46:06","2024-02-26 08:46:06","1031-1043","","4","41","","Coral Reefs","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/CLUAH8U7/Sandin et al. - 2022 - Benthic assemblages are more predictable than fish.pdf","","","Anthropogenic impacts; Community ecology; Oceanography; Spatial autocorrelation; Spatial variation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current approaches that centre around restoring reef cover can be integrated with emerging approaches to enhance coral stress resilience and, thereby, allow reefs to regrow under a new set of environmental conditions. Emerging approaches such as standardized acute thermal stress assays, selective sexual propagation, coral probiotics, and environmental hardening could be feasible and scalable in the real world. However, they must follow decision-making criteria that consider the different reef, environmental, and ecological conditions.

Corals harvest energy through their surface by photosynthesis and heterotrophic feeding, and they divert part of this energy to defend their outer colony perimeter against competitors. Here, we hypothesized that corals with a larger space-filling surface and smaller perimeters increase energy gain while reducing the exposure to competitors. This predicted an association between these two geometric properties of corals and the competitive outcome against other benthic organisms. To test the prediction, fifty coral colonies from the Caribbean island of Curaçao were rendered using digital 3D and 2D reconstructions. The surface areas, perimeters, box-counting dimensions (as a proxy of surface and perimeter space-filling), and other geometric properties were extracted and analyzed with respect to the percentage of the perimeter losing or winning against competitors based on the coral tissue apparent growth or damage. The increase in surface space-filling dimension was the only significant single indicator of coral winning outcomes, but the combination of surface space-filling dimension with perimeter length increased the statistical prediction of coral competition outcomes. Corals with larger surface space-filling dimensions (Ds > 2) and smaller perimeters displayed more winning outcomes, confirming the initial hypothesis. We propose that the space-filling property of coral surfaces complemented with other proxies of coral competitiveness, such as life history traits, will provide a more accurate quantitative characterization of coral competition outcomes on coral reefs. This framework also applies to other organisms or ecological systems that rely on complex surfaces to obtain energy for competition.","2021-06-29","2024-02-26 08:46:49","2024-02-26 08:46:49","2024-02-26 08:46:49","e11213","","","9","","PeerJ","","","","","","","","en","","","","","peerj.com","","Publisher: PeerJ Inc.","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/KGPLZ7G7/George et al. - 2021 - Space-filling and benthic competition on coral ree.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we review the mechanisms regulating lysogeny in complex communities and show that the additive effects of coinfections, diversity and host energic status yield a bimodal distribution of lysogeny as a function of microbial densities. At high cell densities (above 106 cells ml−1 or g−1) and low diversity, coinfections by two or more phages are frequent and excess energy availability stimulates inefficient metabolism. Both mechanisms favour phage integration and characterize the Piggyback-the-Winner dynamic. At low densities (below 105 cells ml−1 or g−1), starvation represses lytic genes and extends the time window for lysogenic commitment, resulting in a higher frequency of coinfections that cause integration. This pattern follows the predictions of the refugium hypothesis. At intermediary densities (between 105 and 106 cells ml−1 or g−1), encounter rates and efficient energy metabolism favour lysis. This may involve Kill-the-Winner lytic dynamics and induction. Based on these three regimes, we propose a framework wherein phage integration occurs more frequently at both ends of the host density gradient, with distinct underlying molecular mechanisms (coinfections and host metabolism) dominating at each extreme.","2021","2024-02-26 08:47:01","2024-02-26 08:47:01","2024-02-26 08:47:01","4098-4111","","8","23","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1462-2920.15640","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/YNFVW6I5/Silveira et al. - 2021 - The landscape of lysogeny across microbial communi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among the newly identified putative prophages, 35% encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs), mostly involved in secondary metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and cofactor and vitamin production. The analysis of integration sites and gene homology showed that 22 of the putative prophages were actually gene transfer agents (GTAs) similar to a GTA of Rhodobacter capsulatus. Twenty-three percent of the predicted prophages were observed in the TARA Oceans viromes generated from free viral particles, suggesting that they represent active prophages capable of induction. The distribution of these prophages was significantly associated with latitude and temperature. The prophages most abundant at high latitudes encoded acpP, an auxiliary metabolic gene involved in lipid synthesis and membrane fluidity at low temperatures. Our results show that prophages and gene transfer agents are significant sources of genomic diversity in roseobacter, with potential roles in the ecology of this globally distributed bacterial group.","2021-06","2024-02-26 08:47:15","2024-02-26 08:47:15","2024-02-26 08:47:15","1115","","6","9","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 6 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/H36WHFTB/Forcone et al. - 2021 - Prophage Genomics and Ecology in the Family Rhodob.pdf","","","auxiliary metabolic genes; global distribution; roseophage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The clinical characteristics and epidemiology of COVID-19 have been extensively investigated, however, only one study so far focused on the patient’s nasopharynx microbiota. In this study we investigated the nasopharynx microbial community of patients that developed different severity levels of COVID-19. We performed 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing from nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from SARS-CoV-2 positive (56) and negative (18) patients in the province of Alicante (Spain) in their first visit to the hospital. Positive SARS-CoV-2 patients were observed and later categorized in mild (symptomatic without hospitalization), moderate (hospitalization), and severe (admission to ICU). We compared the microbiota diversity and OTU composition among severity groups and built bacterial co-abundance networks for each group.ResultsStatistical analysis indicated differences in the nasopharyngeal microbiome of COVID19 patients. 62 OTUs were found exclusively in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, mostly classified as members of the phylum Bacteroidota (18) and Firmicutes (25). OTUs classified as Prevotella were found to be significantly more abundant in patients that developed more severe COVID-19. Furthermore, co-abundance analysis indicated a loss of network complexity among samples from patients that later developed more severe symptoms.ConclusionOur study shows that the nasopharyngeal microbiome of COVID-19 patients showed differences in the composition of specific OTUs and complexity of co-abundance networks. Taxa with differential abundances among groups could serve as biomarkers for COVID-19 severity. Nevertheless, further studies with larger sample sizes should be conducted to validate these results.","2021","2024-02-26 08:47:34","2024-02-26 09:00:52","2024-02-26 08:47:34","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/FHJP76F6/Ventero et al. - 2021 - Nasopharyngeal Microbial Communities of Patients I.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The metabolic byproducts from these bacteria facilitate the colonization and growth of CF pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, a multi-omics study informed the control of putative anaerobic keystone species during a transition in antibiotic therapy of a CF patient. A quantitative metagenomics approach combining sequence data with epifluorescence microscopy showed that during periods of rapid lung function loss, the patient’s lung microbiome was dominated by the anaerobic, mucus-degrading bacteria belonging to Streptococcus, Veillonella, and Prevotella genera. Untargeted metabolomics and community cultures identified high rates of fermentation in these sputa, with the accumulation of lactic acid, citric acid, and acetic acid. P. aeruginosa utilized these fermentation products for growth, as indicated by quantitative transcriptomics data. Transcription levels of P. aeruginosa genes for the utilization of fermentation products were proportional to the abundance of anaerobic bacteria. Clindamycin therapy targeting Gram-positive anaerobes rapidly suppressed anaerobic bacteria and the accumulation of fermentation products. Clindamycin also lowered the abundance and transcription of P. aeruginosa, even though this patient’s strain was resistant to this antibiotic. The treatment stabilized the patient’s lung function and improved respiratory health for two months, lengthening by a factor of four the between-hospitalization time for this patient. Killing anaerobes indirectly limited the growth of P. aeruginosa by disrupting the cross-feeding of fermentation products. This case study supports the hypothesis that facultative anaerobes operated as keystone species in this CF microbiome. Personalized multi-omics may become a viable approach for routine clinical diagnostics in the future, providing critical information to inform treatment decisions.","2021-01","2024-02-26 08:47:49","2024-02-26 08:47:49","2024-02-26 08:47:49","12050","","21","22","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 21 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/2NUAXGUF/Silveira et al. - 2021 - Multi-Omics Study of Keystone Species in a Cystic .pdf","","","anaerobes; clindamycin; fermentation; metabolomics; metagenomics; mucus plugs; transcriptomics; WinCF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While scientific advancements have enhanced the understanding of the functional roles played by various components of the holobiont, there is a growing need to integrate multiple types of molecular data into spatially and temporally resolved frameworks. To that end, we mapped 16S and 18S rDNA metabarcoding, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomic data onto three-dimensional reconstructions of coral colonies to examine microbial diversity, microbial gene expression, and biochemistry on two colonies of the ecologically important, reef-building coral, Orbicella faveolata and their competitors (i.e., adjacent organisms interacting with the corals: fleshy algae, turf algae, hydrozoans, and other corals). Overall, no statistically significant spatial patterns were observed among the samples for any of the data types; instead, strong signatures of the macroorganismal hosts (e.g., coral, algae, hydrozoa) were detected, in the microbiome, the transcriptome, and the metabolome. The 16S rDNA analysis demonstrated higher abundance of Firmicutes in the coral microbiome than in its competitors. A single bacterial amplicon sequence variant from the genus Clostridium was found exclusively in all O. faveolata samples. In contrast to microbial taxa, a portion of the functionally annotated bacterial RNA transcripts (6.86%) and metabolites (1.95%) were ubiquitous in all coral and competitor samples. Machine learning analysis of microbial transcripts revealed elevated T7-like cyanophage-encoded photosystem II transcripts in O. faveolata samples, while sequences involved in bacterial cell division were elevated in turf algal and interface samples. Similar analysis of metabolites revealed that bacterial-produced antimicrobial and antifungal compounds were highly enriched in coral samples.

Lysogens are dominant in the microbially dense environment of the mammalian gut. This observation contrasts with the long-standing hypothesis of lysogeny being favored at low microbial densities, such as in oligotrophic marine environments. Here, we hypothesized that phage coinfections—a well-understood molecular mechanism of lysogenization—increase at high microbial abundances. To test this hypothesis, we developed a biophysical model of coinfection for marine and gut microbiomes. The model stochastically sampled ranges of phage and bacterial concentrations, adsorption rates, lysogenic commitment times, and community diversity from each environment. In 90% of the sampled marine communities, less than 10% of the bacteria were predicted to be lysogenized via coinfection. In contrast, 25% of the sampled gut communities displayed more than 25% of lysogenization. The probability of lysogenization in the gut was a consequence of the higher densities and higher adsorption rates. These results suggest that, on average, coinfections can form two trillion lysogens in the human gut every day. In marine microbiomes, which were characterized by lower densities and phage adsorption rates, lysogeny via coinfection was still possible for communities with long lysogenic commitment times. Our study indicates that different physical factors causing coinfections can reconcile the traditional view of lysogeny at poor host growth (long commitment times) and the recent Piggyback-the-Winner framework proposing that lysogeny is favored in rich environments (high densities and adsorption rates). IMPORTANCE The association of temperate phages and bacterial hosts during lysogeny manipulates microbial dynamics from the oceans to the human gut. Lysogeny is well studied in laboratory models, but its environmental drivers remain unclear. Here, we quantified the probability of lysogenization caused by phage coinfections, a well-known trigger of lysogeny, in marine and gut microbial environments. Coinfections were quantified by developing a biophysical model that incorporated the traits of viral and bacterial communities. Lysogenization via coinfection was more frequent in highly productive environments like the gut, due to higher microbial densities and higher phage adsorption rates. At low cell densities, lysogenization occurred in bacteria with long duplication times. These results bridge the molecular understanding of lysogeny with the ecology of complex microbial communities.","2020-09-15","2024-02-26 08:48:29","2024-02-26 08:48:29","2024-02-26 08:48:29","10.1128/msystems.00353-20","","5","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.asm.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Society for Microbiology","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/K6AGFV2H/Luque and Silveira - 2020 - Quantification of Lysogeny Caused by Phage Coinfec.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, a combination of metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic profiling, and epifluorescence microscopy was used to investigate how the different components of the holobiont including bacteria, viruses, and their associated metabolites mediate ecological interactions between corals and turf algae. The data demonstrate that there was a microbial assemblage unique to the coral-turf algae interface displaying higher microbial abundances and larger microbial cells. This was consistent with previous studies showing that turf algae exudates feed interface and coral-associated microbial communities, often at the detriment of the coral. Further supporting this hypothesis, when the metabolites were assigned a nominal oxidation state of carbon (NOSC), we found that the turf algal metabolites were significantly more reduced (i.e., have higher potential energy) compared to the corals and interfaces. The algae feeding hypothesis was further supported when the ecological outcomes of interactions (e.g., whether coral was winning or losing) were considered. For example, coral holobionts losing the competition with turf algae had higher Bacteroidetes-to-Firmicutes ratios and an elevated abundance of genes involved in bacterial growth and division. These changes were similar to trends observed in the obese human gut microbiome, where overfeeding of the microbiome creates a dysbiosis detrimental to the long-term health of the metazoan host. Together these results show that there are specific biogeochemical changes at coral–turf algal interfaces that predict the competitive outcomes between holobionts and are consistent with algal exudates feeding coral-associated microbes.","2020-06-16","2024-02-26 08:48:45","2024-02-26 08:48:45","2024-02-26 08:48:45","13588-13595","","24","117","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","pnas.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/4KGIWCJU/Roach et al. - 2020 - A multiomic analysis of in situ coral–turf algal i.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we hypothesize that as carrying capacity increases, lysogens escape phage top-down control through superinfection exclusion, overcoming the canonical trade-off between competition and resistance. This hypothesis was tested by developing an ecological model that combined lytic and lysogenic communities and a diversification model that estimated the accumulation of prophages in bacterial genomes. The ecological model sampled phage-bacteria traits stochastically for communities ranging from 1 to 1000 phage-bacteria pairs, and it included a fraction of escaping lysogens proportional to the increase in carrying capacity. The diversification model introduced new prophages at each diversification step and estimated the distribution of prophages per bacteria using combinatorics. The ecological model recovered the range of abundances and sublinear relationship between phage and bacteria observed across eleven ecosystems. The diversification model predicted an increase in the number of prophages per genome as bacterial abundances increased, in agreement with the distribution of prophages on 833 genomes from marine and human-associated bacteria.

The lysogen–lytic viral reproduction switch is central to viral ecology, with diverse ecosystem impacts. It has been argued that lysogeny is favoured in phages at low host densities. This paradigm is based on the fraction of chemically inducible cells (FCIC) lysogeny proxy determined using DNA-damaging mitomycin C inductions. Contrary to the established paradigm, a survey of 39 inductions publications found FCIC to be highly variable and pervasively insensitive to bacterial host density at global, within-environment and within-study levels. Attempts to determine the source(s) of variability highlighted the inherent complications in using the FCIC proxy in mixed communities, including dissociation between rates of lysogeny and FCIC values.

Such physiological transition offers distinct environments to the microbial community associated with corals: an oxygen-rich environment during daylight hours and an oxygen-depleted environment during the night. Most studies of coral reef microbes have been performed on samples taken during the day, representing a bias in the understanding of the composition and function of these communities. We hypothesized that coral circadian physiology alters the composition and function of microbial communities in reef boundary layers. Here, we analyzed microbial communities associated with the momentum boundary layer (MBL) of the Brazilian endemic reef coral Mussismilia braziliensis during a diurnal cycle, and compared them to the water column. We determined microbial abundance and nutrient concentration in samples taken within a few centimeters of the coral's surface every 6 h for 48 h, and sequenced microbial metagenomes from a subset of the samples. We found that dominant taxa and functions in the coral MBL community were stable over the time scale of our sampling, with no significant shifts between night and day samples. Interestingly, the two water column metagenomes sampled 1 m above the corals were also very similar to the MBL metagenomes. When all samples were analyzed together, nutrient concentration significantly explained 40% of the taxonomic dissimilarity among dominant genera in the community. Functional profiles were highly homogenous and not significantly predicted by any environmental variables measured. Our data indicated that water flow may overrule the effects of coral physiology in the MBL bacterial community, at the scale of centimeters, and suggested that sampling resolution at the scale of millimeters may be necessary to address diurnal variation in community composition.","2017","2024-02-26 08:51:11","2024-02-26 09:01:39","2024-02-26 08:51:11","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/X9VGBFTP/Silveira et al. - 2017 - Bacterial Community Associated with the Reef Coral.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Anthropogenic disturbances cause once coral-dominated reefs to become dominated by fleshy organisms, with several outcomes for trophic relationships.

We recently proposed a new dynamic model of bacteria–phage interactions in which lysogeny predominates at high microbial abundance and growth rates. This model, named Piggyback-the-Winner (PtW), contrasts to current accepted models on the frequency of lysis and lysogeny and predicts that phages integrate into their hosts’ genomes as prophages when microbial abundances and growth rates are high. According to PtW, switching to the temperate life cycle reduces phage predation control on bacterial abundance and confers superinfection exclusion, preventing that a closely-related phage infects the same bacterial cell. Here we examine how PtW is important for metazoans. Specifically, we postulate that PtW and the recently described bacteriophage adherence to mucus (BAM) model are strongly interrelated and have an important role in the development of the microbiome. In BAM, phage produced by the microbiome attach to mucins and protect underlying epithelial cells from invading bacteria. Spatial structuring of the mucus creates a gradient of phage replication strategies consistent with PtW. We predict that lysogeny is favored at the top mucosal layer and lytic predation predominates in the bacteria-sparse intermediary layers. The lysogeny confers competitive advantage to commensals against niche invasion and the lytic infection eliminates potential pathogens from deeper mucus layers.","2016-07-06","2024-02-26 08:51:47","2024-02-26 08:51:47","2024-02-26 08:51:47","1-5","","1","2","","npj Biofilms Microbiomes","","","","","","","","en","2016 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/23ULMJL3/Silveira and Rohwer - 2016 - Piggyback-the-Winner in host-associated microbial .pdf","","","Microbiome; Pathogens","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On coral reefs, the proximal causes of microbialization are overfishing and eutrophication, both of which facilitate enhanced growth of fleshy algae, conferring a competitive advantage over calcifying corals and coralline algae. The proposed mechanism for this competitive advantage is the DDAM positive feedback loop (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), disease, algae, microorganism), where DOC released by ungrazed fleshy algae supports copiotrophic, potentially pathogenic bacterial communities, ultimately harming corals and maintaining algal competitive dominance. Using an unprecedented data set of >400 samples from 60 coral reef sites, we show that the central DDAM predictions are consistent across three ocean basins. Reef algal cover is positively correlated with lower concentrations of DOC and higher microbial abundances. On turf and fleshy macroalgal-rich reefs, higher relative abundances of copiotrophic microbial taxa were identified. These microbial communities shift their metabolic potential for carbohydrate degradation from the more energy efficient Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway on coral-dominated reefs to the less efficient Entner–Doudoroff and pentose phosphate pathways on algal-dominated reefs. This ‘yield-to-power’ switch by microorganism directly threatens reefs via increased hypoxia and greater CO2 release from the microbial respiration of DOC.","2016-04-25","2024-02-26 08:52:08","2024-02-26 08:52:08","2024-02-26 08:52:08","1-7","","6","1","","Nat Microbiol","","","","","","","","en","2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Number: 6 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","","Biogeochemistry; Microbial ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Microbialization specifically refers to the increase in the energetic metabolic demands of microbes relative to macrobes and is significantly correlated with increasing human influence on coral reefs. In this study, metabolic theory of ecology is used to quantify the relative contributions of two broad bacterioplankton groups, autotrophs and heterotrophs, to energy flux on 27 Pacific coral reef ecosystems experiencing human impact to varying degrees. The effective activation energy required for photosynthesis is lower than the average energy of activation for the biochemical reactions of the Krebs cycle, and changes in the proportional abundance of these two groups can greatly affect rates of energy and materials cycling. We show that reef-water communities with a higher proportional abundance of microbial autotrophs expend more metabolic energy per gram of microbial biomass.

A trophic model based on the benthic and planktonic primary production was able to predict the observed relative fish biomass in healthy reefs. In contrast, in impacted reefs, the observed omnivorous fish biomass is higher, while that of the herbivorous/coralivorous fish is lower than predicted by the primary production-based model. Incorporating recycling of benthic-derived carbon in the model through microbial and sponge loops explains the difference and predicts the relative fish biomass in both reef types. Increased benthic carbon release rates and bacterial carbon metabolism, but decreased bacterial growth efficiency could lead to carbon losses through respiration and account for the uncoupling of benthic and fish production in phase-shifting reefs.

We detect communities capable of tolerating antibiotic concentrations up to 600 times higher than the clinical levels.

Nevertheless, there is a lack of information about the microbial diversity, photosynthetic potential and ecological interactions within the rhodolith holobiont. Herein, we performed an ecophysiologic and metagenomic analysis of the Abrolhos rhodoliths to understand their microbial composition and functional components. Rhodoliths contained a specific microbiome that displayed a significant enrichment in aerobic ammonia-oxidizing betaproteobacteria and dissimilative sulfate-reducing deltaproteobacteria. We also observed a significant contribution of bacterial guilds (that is, photolithoautotrophs, anaerobic heterotrophs, sulfide oxidizers, anoxygenic phototrophs and methanogens) in the rhodolith metagenome, suggested to have important roles in biomineralization. The increased hits in aromatic compounds, fatty acid and secondary metabolism subsystems hint at an important chemically mediated interaction in which a functional job partition among eukaryal, archaeal and bacterial groups allows the rhodolith holobiont to thrive in the global ocean. High rates of photosynthesis were measured for Abrolhos rhodoliths (52.16 μmol carbon m−2s−1), allowing the entire Abrolhos rhodolith bed to produce 5.65 × 105 tons C per day.

The aim of this study was to investigate bacterial communities in aquatic ecosystems at Ilha Grande, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a preserved insular environment of the Atlantic rain forest and how they correlate with a salinity gradient going from terrestrial aquatic habitats to the coastal Atlantic Ocean. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed chemical and microbiological parameters of water samples and constructed 16S rRNA gene libraries of free living bacteria obtained at three marine (two coastal and one offshore) and three freshwater (water spring, river, and mangrove) environments. A total of 836 sequences were analyzed by MOTHUR, yielding 269 freshwater and 219 marine operational taxonomic units (OTUs) grouped at 97% stringency. Richness and diversity indexes indicated that freshwater environments were the most diverse, especially the water spring. The main bacterial group in freshwater environments was Betaproteobacteria (43.5%), whereas Cyanobacteria (30.5%), Alphaproteobacteria (25.5%), and Gammaproteobacteria (26.3%) dominated the marine ones. Venn diagram showed no overlap between marine and freshwater OTUs at 97% stringency. LIBSHUFF statistics and PCA analysis revealed marked differences between the freshwater and marine libraries suggesting the importance of salinity as a driver of community composition in this habitat. The phylogenetic analysis of marine and freshwater libraries showed that the differences in community composition are consistent. Conclusions/Significance Our data supports the notion that a divergent evolutionary scenario is driving community composition in the studied habitats. This work also improves the comprehension of microbial community dynamics in tropical waters and how they are structured in relation to physicochemical parameters. Furthermore, this paper reveals for the first time the pristine bacterioplankton communities in a tropical island at the South Atlantic Ocean.","2011-03-09","2024-02-26 08:57:13","2024-02-26 08:57:13","2024-02-26 08:57:13","e17789","","3","6","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/PHWACCUG/Silveira et al. - 2011 - Influence of Salinity on Bacterioplankton Communit.pdf","","","Fresh water; Mangrove swamps; Marine bacteria; Marine environments; Phylogenetic analysis; Rivers; Salinity; Sea water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methodology/Principal Findings We compared the diversity and composition of archaea associated with seawater and with the sponges Hymeniacidon heliophila, Paraleucilla magna and Petromica citrina in two distinct environments: Guanabara Bay, a highly impacted estuary in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the nearby Cagarras Archipelago. For this we used metagenomic analyses of 16S rRNA and ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene libraries. Hymeniacidon heliophila was more abundant inside the bay, while P. magna was more abundant outside and P. citrina was only recorded at the Cagarras Archipelago. Principal Component Analysis plots (PCA) generated using pairwise unweighted UniFrac distances showed that the archaeal community structure of inner bay seawater and sponges was different from that of coastal Cagarras Archipelago. Rarefaction analyses showed that inner bay archaeaoplankton were more diverse than those from the Cagarras Archipelago. Only members of Crenarchaeota were found in sponge libraries, while in seawater both Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota were observed. Although most amoA archaeal genes detected in this study seem to be novel, some clones were affiliated to known ammonia oxidizers such as Nitrosopumilus maritimus and Cenarchaeum symbiosum. Conclusion/Significance The composition and diversity of archaeal communities associated with pollution-tolerant sponge species can change in a range of few kilometers, probably influenced by eutrophication. The presence of archaeal amoA genes in Porifera suggests that Archaea are involved in the nitrogen cycle within the sponge holobiont, possibly increasing its resistance to anthropogenic impacts. The higher diversity of Crenarchaeota in the polluted area suggests that some marine sponges are able to change the composition of their associated archaeal communities, thereby improving their fitness in impacted environments.","2010-12-30","2024-02-26 08:57:35","2024-02-26 08:57:35","2024-02-26 08:57:35","e15774","","12","5","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/9849V5GF/Turque et al. - 2010 - Environmental Shaping of Sponge Associated Archaea.pdf","","","Ammonia; Archaea; Archaean biology; Phylogenetic analysis; Ribosomal RNA; Sea water; Species diversity; Sponges","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Best known is the symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae, but Archaea, Bacteria, fungi, viruses, and algal plastids are also abundant. Until now, there is little information concerning microbial communities associated with Brazilian corals. The present study aims to describe the diversity of Archaea, Bacteria, and eukaryotic algal plastid communities associated with two sympatric species, Siderastrea stellata and Mussismilia hispida, from Southeastern Brazil, using 16S rRNA gene libraries. Since corals present a high number of other associated invertebrates, coral barcoding (COI) was performed to confirm the exclusive occurrence of coral DNA in our samples. Our analysis yielded 354 distinct microbial OTUs, represented mainly by novel phylotypes. Richness (Chao1 and ACE) and diversity (H') estimations of the microbial communities associated with both species were high and comparable to other studies. Rarefaction analyses showed that microbial diversity of S. stellata is higher than that of M. hispida. Libshuff comparative analyses showed that the highest microbial community similarity between the two coral species occurred in the bacterial libraries, while archaeal and plastidial communities were significantly different. Crenarchaeota dominated archaeal communities, while Proteobacteria was the most abundant bacterial phylum, dominated by alpha-Proteobacteria. Plastids were also represented by novel phylotypes and did not match with any 16S rRNA sequences of Cyanobacteria and zooxanthellae from GenBank. Our data improves the pool of available information on Brazilian coral microbes and shows corals as sources of diverse prokaryotic and picoeukaryotic communities.","2010-04-01","2024-02-26 09:02:06","2024-02-26 09:02:06","2024-02-26 09:02:06","523-532","","3","59","","Microb Ecol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Archaea; Black Band Disease; Coral Species; Great Barrier Reef; Rarefaction Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To understand the composition and structure of microbial communities in acid mine drainage (AMD) waters associated with Zn mine tailings, molecular diversity of 16S genes was examined using a PCR, cloning, and sequencing approach. A total of 78 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained from samples collected at five different sites in and around mining residues in Sepetiba Bay, Brazil. We analyzed metal concentration, physical, chemical, and microbiological parameters related to prokaryotic diversity in low metal impacted compared to highly polluted environments with Zn at level of gram per liter and Cd–Pb at level of microgram per liter. Application of molecular methods for community structure analyses showed that Archaea and Bacteria groups present a phylogenetic relationship with uncultured environmental organisms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that bacteria present at the five sites fell into seven known divisions, α-Proteobacteria (13.4%), β-Proteobacteria (16.3%), γ-Proteobacteria (4.3%), Sphingobacteriales (4.3%), Actinobacteria (3.2%) Acidobacteria (2.1%), Cyanobacteria (11.9%), and unclassified bacteria (44.5%). Almost all archaeal clones were related to uncultivated Crenarchaeota species, which were shared between high impacted and low impacted waters. Rarefaction curves showed that bacterial groups are more diverse than archaeal groups while the overall prokaryotic biodiversity is lower in high metal impacted environments than in less polluted habitats. Knowledge of this microbial community structure will help in understanding prokaryotic diversity, biogeography, and the role of microorganisms in zinc smelting AMD generation and perhaps it may be exploited for environmental remediation procedures in this area.","2009-03-01","2024-02-26 09:02:23","2024-02-26 09:02:23","2024-02-26 09:02:23","263-271","","2","13","","Extremophiles","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Acidophiles; Archaea; Biodiversity; Ecology; Molecular phylogeny and molecular biology; Phylogeny; Systematics; Zinc mine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compared diversity and composition of the sponge-associated bacteria to those of environmental bacteria, represented by free-living bacterioplankton and by bacteria attached to organic particulate matter in superficial sediments. Partial bacterial 16S rRNA sequences from seawater, sediment, and sponges were retrieved by PCR, cloning, and sequencing. Sequences were subjected to rarefaction analyses, phylogenetic tree construction, and LIBSHUFF quantitative statistics to verify coverage and similarity between libraries. Community structure of the free-living bacterioplankton was phylogenetically different from that of the sponge-associated bacterial assemblages. On the other hand, some sediment-attached bacteria were also found in the sponge bacterial community, indicating that sponges may incorporate bacteria together with sediment particles. Rare and few prokaryotic morphotypes were found in TEM analyses of sponge mesohyl matrix of both species. Molecular data indicate that bacterial richness and diversity decreases from bacterioplankton, to particulate organic sediment, and to H. heliophila and P. janeirensis. Sponges from Rio de Janeiro harbor a pool of novel and exclusive sponge-associated bacterial taxa. Sponge-associated bacterial communities are composed of both taxons shared by many sponge groups and by species-specific bacteria.","2008-08-01","2024-02-26 09:02:33","2024-02-26 09:02:33","2024-02-26 09:02:33","135-146","","2","155","","Mar Biol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Bacterial Community; Bacterial Phylotypes; Sponge; Sponge Species; Sponge Tissue","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The low raining and high evaporation rates in this region favored the development of many salty ponds around the lagoon. In order to reveal the microbial composition of this system, we performed a 16S rRNA gene survey. Among archaea, most clones were related to uncultured environmental Euryarchaeota. In lagoon water, we found some clones related to Methanomicrobia and Methanothermococcus groups, while in the saline pond water members related to the genus Haloarcula were detected. Bacterial community was dominated by clones related to Gamma-proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Synechococcus in lagoon water, while Salinibacter ruber relatives dominated in saline pond. We also detected the presence of Alpha-proteobacteria, Pseudomonas-like bacteria and Verrucomicrobia. Only representatives of the genus Ralstonia were cosmopolitan, being observed in both systems. The detection of a substantial number of clones related to uncultured archaea and bacteria suggest that the hypersaline waters of Araruama harbor a pool of novel prokaryotic phylotypes, distinct from those observed in other similar systems. We also observed clones related to halophilic genera of cyanobacteria that are specific for each habitat studied. Additionally, two bacterioplankton molecular markers with ecological relevance were analyzed, one is linked to nitrogen fixation (nifH) and the other is linked to carbon fixation by bacterial photosynthesis, the protochlorophyllide genes, revealing a specific genetic distribution in this ecosystem. This is the first study of the biogeography and community structure of microbial assemblages in Brazilian tropical hypersaline environments. This work is directed towards a better understanding of the free-living prokaryotic diversity adapted to life in hypersaline waters.","2008-07-01","2024-02-26 09:02:43","2024-02-26 09:02:43","2024-02-26 09:02:43","595-604","","4","12","","Extremophiles","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Biodiversity; Biotechnology; Ecology; Enzymes; Genetics; Halophile; Molecular phylogeny; Phylogeny; Taxonomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
