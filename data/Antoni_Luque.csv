They store their genome at quasi-crystalline densities in capsids built from multiple copies of proteins adopting the HK97-fold. The high density of the genome exerts an internal pressure, requiring a maturation process that reinforces their capsids. However, it is unclear how capsid stabilization strategies have adapted to accommodate the evolution of larger genomes in this virus group. Here we characterized a novel capsid reinforcement mechanism in two evolutionary-related actinobacteriophages that modifies the length of a stabilization protein to accommodate a larger genome while maintaining the same capsid size. We used cryo-EM to reveal that capsids contained split hexamers of HK97-fold proteins with a stabilization protein in the chasm. The observation of split hexamers in mature capsids was unprecedented, so we rationalized this result mathematically, discovering that icosahedral capsids can be formed by all split or skewed hexamers as long as their T-number is not a multiple of three. Our results suggest that analogous stabilization mechanisms can be present in other icosahedral capsids, and they provide a strategy for engineering capsids accommodating larger DNA cargoes as gene delivery systems.","2023-11-03","2024-02-26 03:01:56","2024-02-26 03:01:56","2024-02-26 03:01:56","2023.11.03.565530","","","","","bioRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 37961133 PMCID: PMC10635136","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/46IPY82I/Podgorski et al. - 2023 - A novel stabilization mechanism accommodating geno.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10635136/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many prophages benefit their host, and prophages are responsible for genotypic and phenotypic differences that separate individual microbial strains. However, the microbes also endure a cost to maintain those phages: additional DNA to replicate and proteins to transcribe and translate. We have never quantified those benefits and costs. Here, we analysed over two and a half million prophages from over half a million bacterial genome assemblies. Analysis of the whole dataset and a representative subset of taxonomically diverse bacterial genomes demonstrated that the normalised prophage density was uniform across all bacterial genomes above 2 Mbp. We identified a constant carrying capacity of phage DNA per bacterial DNA. We estimated that each prophage provides cellular services equivalent to approximately 2.4 % of the cell’s energy or 0.9 ATP per bp per hour. We demonstrate analytical, taxonomic, geographic, and temporal disparities in identifying prophages in bacterial genomes that provide novel targets for identifying new phages. We anticipate that the benefits bacteria accrue from the presence of prophages balance the energetics involved in supporting prophages.

The dynamics of our world at biogeochemical, ecological, and astronomical scales exist in a transient state because our planet, Sun, and universe are evolving toward thermodynamic equilibrium. However, predicting the tipping points associated with major dynamical shifts in these systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a new theoretical framework to predict tipping points. Our approach builds on two empirical principles: Observations occur over a finite time, and changes are perceptible when system variations are substantial relative to reference values. As a consequence, processes governing the dynamics of a system can become inactive over an observation time, and tipping points are reached when the processes switch off or on. The two principles were encoded mathematically, defining dynamic weights: contributions relative to reference values of the dynamic processes to the rate-of-change of agents in the system for a finite observational time. Operationally, processes were considered active if their weights were above a critical threshold. Tipping points were defined as reaching critical thresholds that activated or inactivated processes. This Finite Observational Dynamics Analysis Method (FODAM) method predicted that a system with n underlying dynamic processes could display 2n different dynamic regimes. However, the regimes depend on the observational time. The tipping points predicted the conditions for regime shifts and also the resilience of quasi-stable systems to perturbations. The application of FODAM was illustrated with a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model featuring the interaction of bacteria and bacteriophage. A Colab notebook was also developed and deployed online to facilitate the application of the method to other systems. We conclude the article by discussing how our new approach bridges prior frameworks describing tipping point dynamics and critical transitions. We also outline the application of the method to empirical data to predict tipping points in complex systems.","2023-12-27","2024-02-26 03:10:52","2024-02-26 03:10:52","2024-02-26 03:10:52","","","","","","","","","","","","bioRxiv","","en","© 2023, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Their ecological, evolutionary, and biogeochemical roles in the planet stem from their genomic diversity. Known tailed phage genomes range from 10 to 735 kilobase pairs thanks to the size variability of the protective protein capsids that store them. However, the role of tailed phage capsids’ diversity in ecosystems is unclear. A fundamental gap is the difficulty of associating genomic information with viral capsids in the environment. To address this problem, here, we introduce a computational approach to predict the capsid architecture (T-number) of tailed phages using the sequence of a single gene—the major capsid protein. This approach relies on an allometric model that relates the genome length and capsid architecture of tailed phages. This allometric model was applied to isolated phage genomes to generate a library that associated major capsid proteins and putative capsid architectures. This library was used to train machine learning methods, and the most computationally scalable model investigated (random forest) was applied to human gut metagenomes. Compared to isolated phages, the analysis of gut data reveals a large abundance of mid-sized (T = 7) capsids, as expected, followed by a relatively large frequency of jumbo-like tailed phage capsids (T ≥ 25) and small capsids (T = 4) that have been under-sampled. We discussed how to increase the method’s accuracy and how to extend the approach to other viruses. The computational pipeline introduced here opens the doors to monitor the ongoing evolution and selection of viral capsids across ecosystems.","2022-01-01","2024-02-26 03:11:21","2024-02-26 03:11:21","2024-02-26 03:11:21","721-732","","","20","","Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/22NUBN2T/Lee et al. - 2022 - Predicting the capsid architecture of phages from .pdf; /home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/JQZLVF9H/S2001037021005419.html","","","Gut microbiome; Icosahedral capsids; Machine learning; Metagenomes; Physical modeling; Physical virology; Tailed bacteriophages; Viral ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we review the mechanisms regulating lysogeny in complex communities and show that the additive effects of coinfections, diversity and host energic status yield a bimodal distribution of lysogeny as a function of microbial densities. At high cell densities (above 106 cells ml−1 or g−1) and low diversity, coinfections by two or more phages are frequent and excess energy availability stimulates inefficient metabolism. Both mechanisms favour phage integration and characterize the Piggyback-the-Winner dynamic. At low densities (below 105 cells ml−1 or g−1), starvation represses lytic genes and extends the time window for lysogenic commitment, resulting in a higher frequency of coinfections that cause integration. This pattern follows the predictions of the refugium hypothesis. At intermediary densities (between 105 and 106 cells ml−1 or g−1), encounter rates and efficient energy metabolism favour lysis. This may involve Kill-the-Winner lytic dynamics and induction. Based on these three regimes, we propose a framework wherein phage integration occurs more frequently at both ends of the host density gradient, with distinct underlying molecular mechanisms (coinfections and host metabolism) dominating at each extreme.","2021","2024-02-26 03:11:58","2024-02-26 03:11:58","2024-02-26 03:11:58","4098-4111","","8","23","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2021 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1462-2920.15640","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/DMCJEMEQ/Silveira et al. - 2021 - The landscape of lysogeny across microbial communi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Corals harvest energy through their surface by photosynthesis and heterotrophic feeding, and they divert part of this energy to defend their outer colony perimeter against competitors. Here, we hypothesized that corals with a larger space-filling surface and smaller perimeters increase energy gain while reducing the exposure to competitors. This predicted an association between these two geometric properties of corals and the competitive outcome against other benthic organisms. To test the prediction, fifty coral colonies from the Caribbean island of Curaçao were rendered using digital 3D and 2D reconstructions. The surface areas, perimeters, box-counting dimensions (as a proxy of surface and perimeter space-filling), and other geometric properties were extracted and analyzed with respect to the percentage of the perimeter losing or winning against competitors based on the coral tissue apparent growth or damage. The increase in surface space-filling dimension was the only significant single indicator of coral winning outcomes, but the combination of surface space-filling dimension with perimeter length increased the statistical prediction of coral competition outcomes. Corals with larger surface space-filling dimensions (Ds > 2) and smaller perimeters displayed more winning outcomes, confirming the initial hypothesis. We propose that the space-filling property of coral surfaces complemented with other proxies of coral competitiveness, such as life history traits, will provide a more accurate quantitative characterization of coral competition outcomes on coral reefs. This framework also applies to other organisms or ecological systems that rely on complex surfaces to obtain energy for competition.","2021-06-29","2024-02-26 03:12:24","2024-02-26 03:12:24","2024-02-26 03:12:24","e11213","","","9","","PeerJ","","","","","","","","en","","","","","peerj.com","","Publisher: PeerJ Inc.","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/K28SMTBM/George et al. - 2021 - Space-filling and benthic competition on coral ree.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various physicochemical properties can alter the diffusion of microscopic particles in mucus, impacting drug delivery, virus infection, and disease development. The simultaneous effect of these physicochemical properties in particle diffusion, however, remains elusive. Here, we analyzed 106 published experiments to identify the most dominant factors controlling particle diffusion in mucus. The effective diffusion—defined using a one-second sampling time window across experiments—spanned seven orders of magnitude, from 10–5 to 102 μm2/s. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses identified the anomalous exponent (the logarithmic slope of the mean-squared displacement) as the strongest predictor of effective diffusion, revealing an exponential relationship that explained 89% of the variance. A theoretical scaling analysis revealed that a stronger correlation of the anomalous exponent over the generalized diffusion constant occurs for sampling times two orders of magnitude larger than the characteristic molecular (or local) displacement time. This result predicts that at these timescales, the molecular properties controlling the anomalous exponent, like particle–mucus unbinding times or the particle to mesh size ratio, would be the most relevant physicochemical factors involved in passive microrheology of particles in mucus. Our findings contrast with the fact that only one-third of the studies measured the anomalous exponent, and most experiments did not report the associated molecular properties predicted to dominate the motion of particles in mucus. The theoretical foundation of our work can be extrapolated to other systems, providing a guide to identify dominant molecular mechanisms regulating the mobility of particles in mucus and other polymeric fluids.","2021","2024-02-26 03:13:54","2024-02-26 03:14:55","2024-02-26 03:13:54","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/WRS75VMR/Cobarrubia et al. - 2021 - Empirical and Theoretical Analysis of Particle Dif.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lysogens are dominant in the microbially dense environment of the mammalian gut. This observation contrasts with the long-standing hypothesis of lysogeny being favored at low microbial densities, such as in oligotrophic marine environments. Here, we hypothesized that phage coinfections—a well-understood molecular mechanism of lysogenization—increase at high microbial abundances. To test this hypothesis, we developed a biophysical model of coinfection for marine and gut microbiomes. The model stochastically sampled ranges of phage and bacterial concentrations, adsorption rates, lysogenic commitment times, and community diversity from each environment. In 90% of the sampled marine communities, less than 10% of the bacteria were predicted to be lysogenized via coinfection. In contrast, 25% of the sampled gut communities displayed more than 25% of lysogenization. The probability of lysogenization in the gut was a consequence of the higher densities and higher adsorption rates. These results suggest that, on average, coinfections can form two trillion lysogens in the human gut every day. In marine microbiomes, which were characterized by lower densities and phage adsorption rates, lysogeny via coinfection was still possible for communities with long lysogenic commitment times. Our study indicates that different physical factors causing coinfections can reconcile the traditional view of lysogeny at poor host growth (long commitment times) and the recent Piggyback-the-Winner framework proposing that lysogeny is favored in rich environments (high densities and adsorption rates). IMPORTANCE The association of temperate phages and bacterial hosts during lysogeny manipulates microbial dynamics from the oceans to the human gut. Lysogeny is well studied in laboratory models, but its environmental drivers remain unclear. Here, we quantified the probability of lysogenization caused by phage coinfections, a well-known trigger of lysogeny, in marine and gut microbial environments. Coinfections were quantified by developing a biophysical model that incorporated the traits of viral and bacterial communities. Lysogenization via coinfection was more frequent in highly productive environments like the gut, due to higher microbial densities and higher phage adsorption rates. At low cell densities, lysogenization occurred in bacteria with long duplication times. These results bridge the molecular understanding of lysogeny with the ecology of complex microbial communities.","2020-09-15","2024-02-26 03:16:03","2024-02-26 03:16:03","2024-02-26 03:16:03","10.1128/msystems.00353-20","","5","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.asm.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Society for Microbiology","","/home/abelardoacm/Zotero/storage/U3UB6LAL/Luque and Silveira - 2020 - Quantification of Lysogeny Caused by Phage Coinfec.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This contrasts the classical view of lysogeny as a refuge used by phages under poor host growth conditions. Here we hypothesize that as carrying capacity increases, lysogens escape phage top-down control through superinfection exclusion, overcoming the canonical trade-off between competition and resistance. This hypothesis was tested by developing an ecological model that combined lytic and lysogenic communities and a diversification model that estimated the accumulation of prophages in bacterial genomes. The ecological model sampled phage-bacteria traits stochastically for communities ranging from 1 to 1000 phage-bacteria pairs, and it included a fraction of escaping lysogens proportional to the increase in carrying capacity. The diversification model introduced new prophages at each diversification step and estimated the distribution of prophages per bacteria using combinatorics. The ecological model recovered the range of abundances and sublinear relationship between phage and bacteria observed across eleven ecosystems. The diversification model predicted an increase in the number of prophages per genome as bacterial abundances increased, in agreement with the distribution of prophages on 833 genomes from marine and human-associated bacteria. The study of lysogeny presented here offers a framework to interpret viral and microbial abundances and reconciles the Kill-the-Winner and Piggyback-the-Winner paradigms in viral ecology.","2020-04-09","2024-02-26 03:16:33","2024-02-26 03:16:33","2024-02-26 03:16:33","","","","","","","","","","","","bioRxiv","","en","© 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.
